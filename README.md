## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a meteorologist and HPC system architect passionate about merging science with technology to shape the future. I hold both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Atmospheric Science from National Central University, where I specialized in cloud microphysics using MM5 and WRF models.

At the Meteorological Bureau, I led the Global Data Assimilation team for over a decade, advancing systems like the Global Ensemble Prediction System for Typhoon Track and developing hybrid assimilation techniques such as 3DEnVar and 4DEnVar.

Currently at the Central Weather Administration, I oversee High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systemsâ€”ensuring the stability and scalability of critical meteorological infrastructure.

My deep meteorological training provides a strong foundation to explore new frontiers. I'm now diving into Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I believe the fusion of atmospheric science and AI will revolutionize forecasting, disaster response, and scientific computing in the years ahead.

ðŸŒ€ Weather-trained.
ðŸ¤– AI-curious.
ðŸš€ Future-focused.
