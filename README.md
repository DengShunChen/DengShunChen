## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
During my tenure at National Central University, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Atmospheric Science, I immersed myself in research on cloud microphysics modules within MM5 and WRF models. 

Transitioning to the Meteorological Bureau, my focus shifted towards testing and developing global data assimilation systems. 
Over ten years, I led the Global Data Assimilation team, pioneering advancements such as the Global Ensemble Prediction System for Typhoon Track and innovative techniques like Hybrid 3DEnVar and Hybrid 4DEnVar. 

Presently, at the Central Meteorological Administration, I manage the maintenance of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, seamlessly merging my atmospheric science expertise with IT proficiency to ensure the reliability of critical meteorological infrastructure.
